# MultiSenseGolf: A Multimodal Wearable Sensor Dataset for Sensor-Fusion-Based Golf Swing Pose Estimation

MultiSenseGolf is a multimodal wearable sensor-based golf swing motion dataset tailored to train sensor fusion-based 3D human pose estimation (HPE). It consists of 1,557 swing samples from 24 participants ranging from beginners to professionals. The dataset integrates synchronized streams from a 17-channel whole-body IMU system, custom insole pressure sensors, a glass-type sensor recording first-person view (FPV) video with gaze tracking, and external RGB-D video. Post-hoc temporal alignment across heterogeneous sensors is established using an event-based time synchronization procedure. Additionally, shot outcome metrics recorded by a vision-based launch monitor, such as carry distance and ball speed, are provided as metadata.
